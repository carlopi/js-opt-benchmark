Benchmarks for "A JavaScript optimizing compiler"

Check it out live: [benchmark](https://carlopi.github.io/js-opt-benchmark/)

This is an experiment: (typed) JavaScript to C++ to optimized JavaScript compiler.

Read the article: [A JavaScript optimizing compiler](https://medium.com/leaningtech/a-javascript-optimizing-compiler-3fd3f49bd071).

Types added manually, C++ generated by a custom [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) AST visitor, heavy lifting done by [Cheerp](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-meta).

Benchmarking performed client side, thanks to [Benchmark.js](https://benchmarkjs.com/). Higher ops/sec is better.
